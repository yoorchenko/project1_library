In this project, I`ve build a book review website. Users are able to register for this website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they are able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. Here I`m using a third-party API by Goodreads, another review website, to pull ratings from a broader audience. Information about books, users, reviews and ratings is stored in PostgreSQL database, hosted on Heroku(hobby dev). Information about all books was loaded from .csv file, using script "import.py", which is in repository too.

This project was made as a part of education from CS50W courses.
